-> How to change item stats:
1. Activate 'Equipment Mods' script
2. Mouse over an item. Script populates item stats in the table and item editor. NB! An equipped item always has priority over other items.
3. Change item stats. Use item editor to change complex values like strings because it allocates memory for them.
4. Put item into stash. At this moment item stats rerolling.
5. Now the item has updated stats.
